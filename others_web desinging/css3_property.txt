Types of website or webpage layout
----------------------------------
 there are 4 types of layouts
 -----------------------------
 
 1)static
 2)fluid 
 3)Adaptive
 4)responsive
 
 static layout
 =============
 In this layout, all width and height of the HTML element are mentioned
 in pixcels.
 
 Disadvantage
 ============
  when we decrease the screen size, it generate horizontal scroll bar and user
  need to scroll horizontally which gives bad user experience
  
  Fluid layout
  ============
  In this layout, dimensions are mentioned in percentage, this layout
  removes disadvatage of static layout.
  
  when we decrease screen size, the element decreases in the size
  and content can be view in a single site by the user.
  
  disadvatage
  ===========
  if the width mentioned in the percentage is too small, on decrease in the size
  of the sreen, content become narrow and it is difficult for the user
  to read that contnet
