Sementic Tags and Non-sementic Tags.
--------------------------------------

Semantic Tags
-------------
The tags which provides meaning to the browser
as well as developer are called as semantic
tags.
In short, the tags which convey their content or functionality to
the browser and developer by their name are called semantic tags.

Element: <opentag>content</closetag>

E.g:<form>,<table>,<em>,<strong>,<p>,<h1>,....<h6>, etc.

Non-semantic Tag 
----------------
The tags which do not specify the meaning 
to the browser as well as developer are called
as Non-Semantic tags.

In short, by the names of the non-semantic tags we can not guess the 
functionality or formating that the tags do.
E.g:
	<div>,<span>,<b>,<i> etc.

    <div>
	       <h1>HTML</h1>
		   <p>
		      HTML is a tagging language.
		   </p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	       <h1>CSS</h1>
		   <p>
		     CSS is used for presentation.
		   </p>
	</div>


Advantages of semantic tags:

1) SEO optimization.
2) Code maintainability.

HTML 5 sementic tags.

Body of the html document is generally divided into three parts:
1) Header 2)Body 3)Footer

before the introduction of HTML 5 semantic tags, developer were using
the following format to code the HTML document.

<html>
	<head>

	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="header">
          	<div id="logo">
		  		company logo
		  	</div>
		  
		  	<div id="menu">
		  		menu bar
		  	</div>
		</div>

		<div id="main">
           	<div id="section">
		   
			</div>
			<div id="aside">
			
			</div>
		   
		   
		</div>

		<div id="footer">
        		<div id="address">
		
			</div>
		
			<div id="social">
		
			</div>
			<div id="links">
		
			</div>
   
		</div>


Although this way writing the code is easy
for the developer from the point of view of
code maintainability,but it was creating problem
for search Engines.

As a result W3C(world wide web consortium) took a
decision to convert these ids into tags.

<header>,<footer>,<address>,<main>,<menu>,<sidebar>, etc.
for the purpose of search enging optimization.
